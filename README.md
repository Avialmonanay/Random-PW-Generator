# Random-PW-Generator


This application is a random password generator that uses a users preferences and random math to generate a secure password.

The base level of the password will provide a password containing 20 charectars with a mix of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and symbols. The user then has the option to adjust the length between 8 and 128 charectars (displayed on screen for user convienence). They can then choose to exclude Numbers, Symbols, or Uppercase charectars leaving you with only a random lowercase password.

This application features a large generate password button that when clicked returns a password on the screen. It also features a clearly marked and visibly well placed Copy Password button that allows the user to easily copy their new password to the clip board. The user will also receive an Alert when the copy password button is clicked letting them know it is ready to use.


This application features 2 sizes that scale depending on resolution.

The first size is simple, easy to follow, and does not overcrowd the user with options. It hits all the marks and imediately provides you with the most secure option for password creation so you do not have to fiddle with any perameters.

The second size is formatted for mobile devices. It features large buttons for easy touch compatability but does not require the user to scroll to be able to see all of their options. CSS media functions allow for very small resolutions providing any user access to its functions. This design makes for a quick and intuitive user experience.
